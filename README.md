# How It's Made

Tech used: HTML and CSS

I started with a paper drawing of the grid, noting which items would make sense where. From there I created HTML containers to house my content, my projects, etc. I wanted to use icons in place of images - I did this. I also wanted to add hyperlinks for areas. If this was a webpage, additional html pages would be created and linked but for this project, it was kept a touch more simple to focus on learning and improving Grid layout.

CSS also came in play. I furthered practice and bettered design choices. I learned how to add gradient's to backgrounds, how to target spans/text, and how to blend Grid and Flex layouts together.

# Lessons Learned

This was a great project to use Grid layout designs. I learned how to layout items across the grid, place a grid within a grid, and even more powerfully, how to use Flex and Grid layouts cohesively.
I utilized span and class types to target certain text and calendar dates.
Additionally, I learned how to use icons instead of images where it's useful.
